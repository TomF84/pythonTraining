At start-up:
import os
os.chdir("C:\\Users\\faanb\\Desktop\\pythonTraining\\chapter_01")

to run something:
exec(open('ex9.py').read())
Or with arguments:
subprocess.call(['python3' 'ex13.py', 'arg1', 'arg2']), but this runs in the backgroud only.
Best is just open a cmd and cd Desktop\pythonTraining\chapter_01

Index of exercises:

Ex1.py:  A first program (string "hello world")
Ex2.py:  Commenting
Ex3.py:  Numbers and math
Ex4.py:  Variables and names, string formatting ("Autos", autos, "eind")
Ex5.py:  More variables and string printing/formatting (f-string)
Ex6.py:  Strings and Text (format())
Ex7.py:  More formatting, text multiplication, end of line modification
Ex8.py:  Using a formatter (Might be useful for LaTeX tables!)
Ex9.py:  Multiline formatting (Triple """), could be used for Headers/Footers!
Ex10.py: Escape characters, useful table with all options. \\ \' \" \a \b \f \n \N{name} \r \t \uxxxx \Uxxxxxxxx \v \000 \xhh
Ex11.py: Use input() to get information from users.
Ex12.py: More input, but now more compact, pydoc (help in interpreter).
Ex13.py: Using arguments to a script (ValueError is thrown when not enough arguments are provided)
Ex14.py: Combining input and argv to talk to the user (simple games can be constructed like that)
Ex15.py: Input en files open/closing
Ex16.py: Reading and writing of files, truncating them, modifying them (seek(), truncate())
Ex17.py: More file manipulations, short optimisation of scripts
Ex18.py: First look at functions (arguments)
Ex19.py: More work on functinos
Ex20.py: Functions and files 
Ex21.py: Returning stuff from functions, puzzle: The functions are called inside out (starts on deepest level and works upwards)
Ex22.py: Need to memorize stuff, but partially already done in this file.
Ex23.py: Bytes, strings, encodings and decodings, a nice loop with a function calliny on itself repetitively.
Ex24.py: A bit more work with formatting strings, working with functions, some new tools (passing a list to format!.
Ex25.py: Working more with functions and importing a script
Ex26.py: A test fixing/debugging someone else's code.
Ex27.py: Just an exercise outside of programming
Ex28.py: Test for Boolean logics. Answers by me are in Ex28a.py Ex28.log is the output, this should equal Ex28a.py
